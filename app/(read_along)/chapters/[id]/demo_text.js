            Lasfam returned to the estate by carriage and announced that we were to take lunch in the castle. Lieseleta
            had already known—she had received advance notice via an ordonnanz—so the seamstresses had already taken
            their leave, and everything was ready for our departure. Hannelore and I climbed into our carriage with our
            respective guard knights.
         </p>
         <p>
            &quot;So, how should we convince Lord Ferdinand to agree to this political marriage?&quot; Hannelore asked
            with a straight face. &quot;My knowledge of the man comes entirely from the tales Heisshitze and the others
            have told me, so no ideas come to mind. Would demanding some proposal challenges from Lord Ferdinand and
            completing them not work?&quot;
         </p>
         <p>
            The last thing I wanted was to go all Clarissa on Ferdinand. I doubted that such an approach would even work
            on him; he would surely smirk and refuse to give me any challenges at all. Rather than try to bully him into
            a marriage he would never, ever want, I was resolved to secure him a laboratory in Ehrenfest, his Geduldh.
         </p>
         <p>
            <em>I&apos;ll need to consult him about it before these </em>loons<em> descend on him.</em>
         </p>
         <p>
            If anyone was going to take action, it was going to be at lunch, when the archducal couple was expected to
            be in attendance. I needed to leak Hannelore&apos;s scheme to Ferdinand and then work with him to devise
            unbeatable countermeasures; otherwise, he was going to be pushed into a second political marriage by the
            same people who had brought about his first. Hannelore must already have forgotten my remark that she and
            her duchy should stay in their lane.
         </p>
         <p>
            <em>But fear not, Ferdinand! You can count on me to fight your corner!</em>
         </p>
         <p>
            &quot;Leonore, send word to Ferdinand,&quot; I said. &quot;I wish to speak with him before lunch.&quot; It
            was a request one would normally make of one&apos;s attendants, but for reasons of status, Lieseleta
            wasn&apos;t with me.
         </p>
         <p>&quot;As you will,&quot; Leonore replied. &quot;But is this not too sudden?&quot;</p>
         <p>&quot;If you tell him the circumstances are dire, I am sure he will make time for me.&quot;</p>
         <p>
            As much as he frowned and shook his head about it, Ferdinand always made time to listen to whatever was
            bothering me and help me work through it. This particular disaster risked changing both of our lives, so I
            doubted he would mind me sharing this intelligence with him.
            <br />
            <br />
         </p>
         <p>&quot;FERDINAND!&quot;</p>
         <p>
            He had made time for me—as expected—and prepared a room close to the dining hall where our lunch meeting was
            being held. I&apos;d arrived to find not only him and his retinue but also my male retainers and Clarissa,
            who was advising on how to host our guests.
         </p>
         <p>
            &quot;So, Rozemyne—what are these &apos;dire circumstances&apos;?&quot; Ferdinand asked, his brow knit in
            its usual tight frown. &quot;Dare I ask what you have done this time?&quot;
         </p>
         <p>
            &quot;It wasn&apos;t me—I mean, it wasn&apos;t something <em>I</em> did—but this really is serious, and
            you&apos;re going to be forced into a political—&quot;
         </p>
         <p>
            &quot;Calm down. You are far too energetic. <em>And</em> you look rather unwell...&quot;
         </p>
         <p>
            Ferdinand reached out to check my temperature, but I grabbed his hand and squeezed it tight. &quot;At this
            rate, you might be forced to marry me! Run! RUN AWAYYY!&quot;
         </p>
         <p>
            &quot;I do not understand a word of what you are telling me. Explain everything that led to your coming
            here—but not before I activate a sound-blocker. I imagine this is not something to be discussed
            openly.&quot;
         </p>
         <p>
            Ferdinand grimaced and waved his free hand, prompting Hartmut to activate an area-wide sound-blocker.
            Justus, having finished preparing tea, then instructed the gathered retainers to step outside the
            sound-blocker&apos;s radius. The fact we were using this magic tool showed just how considerate my retainers
            were; they knew I wasn&apos;t in any state to hold a feystone.
         </p>
         <p>&quot;Now... why the melancholic smile?&quot; Ferdinand asked.</p>
         <p>
            &quot;I am sad to have troubled my retainers... but also touched that they would do so much for me.&quot;
         </p>
         <p>
            &quot;I see. They surely want the burden on you to be as light as can be, so make your explanation quick, if
            you would.&quot;
         </p>
         <p>
            I watched my retainers have their own conversations out of the corner of my eye as I explained the events of
            the sitting. First, I went into Hannelore and the others&apos; misunderstanding that I was in love with him
            and the immense amount of support they had thrown behind the idea. Then I dropped the bomb—their conclusion
            that we should enter a political marriage.
         </p>
         <p>
            &quot;I told them my true desires,&quot; I said. &quot;But when I mentioned that I didn&apos;t want any
            unnecessary burdens, Lady Hannelore and my retainers all started insisting we get married. They changed
            their stances in a heartbeat. It doesn&apos;t make any sense whatsoever, does it?&quot;
         </p>
         <p>
            &quot;No, it makes perfect sense, if you ask me. They foresaw the disaster that would come from you having
            unchecked power and decided you would need someone to control it for you.&quot;
         </p>
         <p>
            Rather than openly agreeing with me, Ferdinand seemed exhausted. He noted that I was the only one who
            didn&apos;t understand the situation and then launched into a lecture, glaring at me all the while.
         </p>
         <p>
            &quot;Their exasperation about your library scheme must have contributed, but even putting that aside, every
            single person who heard your remarks deduced that they were dangerous. Do you not know why the country gates
            were placed outside the borders—why teleporters to the Royal Academy all connect to their respective
            duchies&apos; dormitories? Is it not clear why their activation requires the aub, or why they can only
            transport a few people at once despite how many students need to use it each year?&quot;
         </p>
         <p>&quot;Umm...&quot;</p>
         <p>
            &quot;If you had stopped to think for even a moment, you would have realized that a Zent adding teleporters
            to libraries and placing them wherever she pleased would absolutely devastate duchy security. Even if you
            had the best intentions, someone would eventually decide to exploit every weakness you created. It should
            come as no surprise that an archduke candidate from Dunkelfelger—especially one learned in her duchy&apos;s
            long history—would start to be wary. Fool.&quot;
         </p>
         <p>
            I&apos;d assumed Ferdinand was exhausted because I was so clearly in the right that discussing the matter
            was a waste of time, but I couldn&apos;t have been more mistaken. His scolding came so suddenly that the
            most I could do was blurt out random excuses.
         </p>
         <p>
            &quot;I was just listing my ideals as they came to me... It wasn&apos;t like I expected them to come true.
            My main focus was distracting everyone from thinking I was in love with you.&quot;
         </p>
         <p>
            &quot;Did you not declare that marrying Prince Sigiswald would make your goal easy to achieve? Even if you
            said it without thinking—as you are wont to do—Lady Hannelore immediately understood the risk of your
            &apos;dreams&apos; coming true. The teleportation circles aside, I am sure her mind wandered to all the
            other bizarre claims you decided to make &apos;as they came to you.&apos;&quot;
         </p>
         <p>
            I managed only a small peep in response. Not thinking things through had produced truly dire consequences in
            the past.
         </p>
         <p>
            &quot;Oh, the agony... I cultivated the ideal reputation for you—a perfect archduke candidate shrouded in
            the divinity of sainthood—and you cast it all aside for the most foolish reasons. I cannot say I ever
            expected my hard work to evaporate quite like this. Were all those reminders during the feast not enough for
            you to know the importance of maintaining appearances?&quot;
         </p>
         <p>
            &quot;Ngh... It came up so regularly that I started to drown it out. You can only hear the same warning so
            many times before it starts to wear on you.&quot;
         </p>
         <p>
            &quot;I would call you a fool, but the word no longer feels strong enough...&quot; Ferdinand muttered. He
            sounded as bitter as ever, but was this really the time to bemoan the subtleties of an insult? Surely our
            battle plan was what mattered most right now.
         </p>
         <p>
            &quot;My reputation aside,&quot; I said, &quot;unless we take action before Lady Hannelore and the others
            begin their rampage, I suspect you will again be dragged away from your Geduldh. I can try to convince
            Sylvester to build you a laboratory here in Ehrenfest, so let us start planning now—ow ow <em>owww</em>
            !&quot;
         </p>
         <p>
            &quot;You have brought me such excellent intelligence,&quot; Ferdinand said. He had pinched my cheek and
            pulled to stop me from speaking. &quot;For that, I thank you.&quot;
         </p>
         <p>
            &quot;You sure don&apos;t <em>seem</em> thankful...&quot; I shot back, rubbing my aching cheek and glaring
            at him.
         </p>
         <p>
            Ferdinand cast a glance at the door, so I did the same. Angelica, whom I&apos;d stationed outside the room,
            was poking her head in to get our attention.
         </p>
         <p>&quot;It must be lunchtime,&quot; Ferdinand remarked.</p>
         <p>
            &quot;Listen to me, Ferdinand... You have devoted so much of your life to that promise you made. Going
            forward, I ask that you focus on your own dreams. No matter what Sylvester, Lady Hannelore, or anyone else
            says, do <em>not</em> surrender. Do everything in your power to secure the future you desire.&quot; I
            clenched my fist, wanting to hammer home my determination and support. If we could survive this lunch, the
            Dunkelfelgerians would return home.
         </p>
      </>
