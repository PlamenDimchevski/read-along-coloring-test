Ferdinand silently opened the door to the hidden room, pondering what medicine and magic tools could be used to get Rozemyne out of this situation. Fran and Zahm carried her inside on the bench, then promptly exited and closed the door behind them. The moment they were gone, Rozemyne’s expression morphed into an unhappy frown. Both Wilfried and Charlotte had left her behind as well. Ferdinand was well aware of this, but he chose to remain silent. Given that Rozemyne had worked almost foolishly hard to be an excellent and respectable big sister, he didn’t even want to imagine how she would react to learning that her little sister was now taller than her. Ferdinand let out a heavy sigh, then immediately realized Rozemyne’s mana was likely wavering. Her voice became increasingly distraught, and her worried eyes shifted in color from their familiar gold to a violently shifting rainbow.',

It was concluded that the guard knights had not acted improperly, but for failing to protect their charges, they were punished with decreased salaries.”',
